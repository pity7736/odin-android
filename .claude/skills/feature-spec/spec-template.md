<!--
CANONICAL SPEC FORMAT. This template is the single source of truth for the
structure of a spec.md. Copy it into specs/<module>/<feature>/spec.md and fill
every section, then DELETE all HTML comments.

RULES (from docs/01-principles.md and CLAUDE.md):
- Business-focused, NOT technical. A Product Manager must understand it.
- FORBIDDEN words: Compose, Room, Retrofit, ViewModel, UiState, coroutine, Flow,
  HTTP, REST, API, endpoint, DAO, repository, use case, database, JSON, Keystore,
  screen, tap, button.
- Use business language: users, accounts, income, balance, log in, save, etc.
- Describe intended behavior — what the feature SHOULD do. If current code has
  bugs, the spec is the source of truth for correct behavior, not the code.

<!-- 1-3 sentences: why this matters to a user, in business terms. -->

As a <user>, I want to <goal>, so that <benefit>.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- Bullet list of what must be true for the feature to be considered done.
     Each bullet is a business rule, not a technical step. -->

## Expected Behavior

     rejection/edge case the user can hit. -->

### <scenario name>
- Given <starting situation>
- When <the user does something>
- Then <the observable outcome>
- And <additional outcome, optional>

## Out of Scope
<!-- List what this feature deliberately does NOT cover, so reviewers know the
     boundaries. -->
